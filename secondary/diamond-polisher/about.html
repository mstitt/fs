<p>The polishing pads are somewhat used, but still have some life.  There
is one each of most of them, but a few extra of the 50 and 100 grit
versions.</p>
<p>Includes two backing pads (the piece that you velcro your polishing
pad onto), each with their own arbor (the shaft that chucks into the
drill).</p>
<p>The drill is a Black-and-Decker reversable, variable-speed, with a
loooong cord.</p>
<p>Also includes a "turbo grinding cup", which is a really coarse diamond
grinder for doing a first-smoothing of concrete and/or stone
(something like 20-grit I'd guess).  It also has its own arbor.</p>
<p>!! ADD IN THE WIRE BRUSH AND FIBER BRUSH</p>
